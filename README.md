This visualization shows the number of bikes that are used for 1-6 hours. There are around 3000 bikes being used for 5 hours or longer.

Here it breaks down the users by gender to show how long females and males ride for. Looking at the visualization, it is clear there are more male riders riding for 5 hours or longer than there are female riders.

Looking at this visualization, it can be determined that on Thursdays between 5 and 6 PM is when most people are starting their ride.

![Trips_by_Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74940620/215010987-044b5e0e-dc1e-45a9-9838-0a1c41eefe58.png)

This visualization is similar to the last, only it breaks down the data in gender. More males appear to be riding during the hours of 5 and 6 PM.

![User_Trips_by_Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74940620/215011232-03cdb9f8-3d77-488b-b308-d0dc8a6db811.png)

Here it breaks down the user type and whether they are female or male. Looking at the visualization, there are more male subscribers than there are female subscribers.

## Summary
Male subscribers are the target market consisdering they are the highest users. More male users are riding during traditionally high use times. There should be marketing to increase the amount of female users. One additional visualization I would create would be the location are the geograhpical data more to see if there are more favored routes to travel depending on the time of day.
